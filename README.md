# Computational Modeling of Diabetic Heart Cells

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the "Computational Modeling of Diabetic Heart Cells" project. This project aims to develop computational models to simulate the behavior of heart cells under diabetic conditions. By understanding the cellular mechanisms involved in diabetic heart disease, we aim to provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies and interventions.

## Initial Set up the Repository
1. Open GitCmd, terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the folder you want to set up the repo in using
```bash
cd whatever\the\path\is
```
4. To clone the repository onto your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/computational-modeling-diabetic-heart-cells.git
```

## Git commands
Overall Process
1. Make changes to code locally and save them /  Add files to local repo
2. Open command prompt and navigate to local repo 
3. Check what modifications have been made, what is or is not being tracked
```bash
git status
```
3. Add the changes by either adding a filename or all changes
```bash
git add filename   # Stage a specific file
git add .          # Stage all changes
```
4. Commit the changes with a message
```bash
git commit -m "Brief description of the changes made"
```
5. Push the changes to your branch NOT main
```bash
git push origin <NAME_OF_BRANCH>
```

### Pulling Changes from GitHub
Incorporate changes from GitHub into your local repository:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
Or if you want to pull locally your branch you are working on before you made changes
```bash
git pull origin <NAME_OF_BRANCH>
```

### Pull Requsts
Once you have pushed to your own branch you can create a pr for changes to merge them into main.
